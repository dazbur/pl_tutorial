0. Before we start: Drop the Hive table "City". We will be importing it again.

1. Oozie workflows can be executed from any node in the cluster. Therefore everything the workflow will need should be on HDFS.

Create /user/cloudera/workflow directory in HDFS and in it:
 - lib subdirectory with the SerDe Jar
 - MySQL driver in same subdirectory (copy from /usr/lib/sqoop/lib)
 - hive-site.xml with hive configuration (copy from /etc/hive/conf)
 - hive script creating the external earthquakes table
 - hive script creating "top 10 most populated" cities table

2. create job.properties file - this file should include:
- namenode
- jobtracker
- workflow directory
- flag to use external libraries (needed for both Sqoop and Hive): oozie.use.system.libpath=true

3. Create workflow.xml file with the following workflow actions:
- Sqoop action to create Hive cities table
- Hive action to create external earthquakes table
- Hive action to create "top 10 most populated" cities 

4. Copy workflow.xml to the workflow directory in HDFS. 
And use oozie to execute the workflow

5. Validate that all 3 tables were created
