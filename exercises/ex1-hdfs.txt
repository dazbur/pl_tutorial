1. Create HDFS directories:
	/etl/earthquakes/landing
	and /data
   That belong to user "cloudera"

2. You can find the earthquake data in ~/datasets/earthquake.json
Copy it to /etl/earthquakes/landing directory you just created

3. Print out the first 10 lines of the file from HDFS

4. How many blocks do you have in the file? What is the replication factor?
