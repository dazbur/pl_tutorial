1. Add the SerDe jar to the classpath using "add jar". List jars to validate.
You can find the jar in hive-serdes/target directory.

2. Create an external table for accessing the earthquake data in HDFS using the JSON SerDE

3. Validate the table by selecting the first two rows.
Then find the avg magnitude of earthquakes in our file

4. Find 10 most populated cities from our cities_coords table in Hive

5. Find top 10 cities and their population which have largest earthquakes in our data set. Select only cities that have population of more than 100 people.

Tips:
a. Use properties.place field to find which city is closest to eqrthquake epicenter
b. Use Hive regexp_extract to get city and state from string. Check Hive docs for examples -- https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+UDF
c. Join cities_coors table to get population
